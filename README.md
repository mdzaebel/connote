# Connote 
Minimal associative selection *(under construction)*

## What is *Connote*?
Web-based knowledge modeling, using words, relations and links (sentences). It lets you structure important information via multi-dimensional links and:
* **explore** 
  * knowledge by clicking on relations (linked terms)
  * typing with autocompletion
* **create**
  * data models via links
  * links by simply typing the terms
* **edit**
  * Excel like input
  * HTML descriptions for terms
  * Name of terms
* **visualize**
  * Tree tables reduced to really necessary information
## Why?
* The world is increasingly complex, cross-linked and faster. We need dynamic knowledge-nets accessible from arbitray starting points.
## Vision
* What if you just see what you need by linking terms?
## How?
* ToDo [Test](Test)
## Aims?
